WAP MMS Message Encoder
=======================

Extremely simple encoder for application/vnd.wap.mms-message payloads.

This code is based on work done at 
https://github.com/pmarti/python-messaging which in turn includes work 
and concepts included from other sources like pysms and python-mms.

Initial work will be done against Python 3.8 and slowly adapted to other 
Python 3.x versions.

Features
--------

Encode a dead simple MMS message payload compatible with many WAP 2.0 
gateways.
